# Planimals


A hackathon project with a unique take on the to-do list concept featuring a virtual pet dependency system. Utilizing AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Node.js for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, we created an engaging web application.


## Reflection

Planimals, emerged from a hackathon setting where our team aimed to craft a full-stack web application with a twist on conventional to-do lists. We sought to integrate a playful element by associating tasks with the care of a virtual "pet," adding a layer of accountability and engagement to task completion.

The endeavor was particularly challenging yet enriching as it marked my first experience in a hackathon where I assumed a leadership role due to my relatively higher experience level within the team. This leadership responsibility allowed me to make pivotal decisions regarding project direction and architecture, giving me first person experience with the significance of early-stage planning in such endeavors.

One unexpected hurdle we encountered was the significant time investment required to familiarize the team with the new technologies and languages essential for web development. Other than myself, the team had little to no web development experience. However, this challenge served as an opportunity for me to leverage my experience to facilitate learning among team members, thereby reinforcing my own understanding of these concepts.

Despite the initial learning curve, our team effectively leveraged AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Node.js for the backend, complemented by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. These choices were deliberate, as they offered flexibility, scalability, and customization options essential for our project's unique requirements, showcasing our ability to make informed and strategic technology decisions.

Ultimately, the hackathon concluded with a tangible product that not only met our initial vision but also enriched our collective understanding of web development. Personally, I gained valuable insights into leadership, teamwork, and the art of effectively teaching others while working alongside them.
